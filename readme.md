# Axum-svue

A fully featured api that returns json gradedata. A hosted version is available at
https://svue.zillorz.dev/ or https://axum-svue.fly.dev

To host, make sure the VERSION_NUMBER and ENKEY variables are set.

VERSION_NUMBER is the current studentvue app version

ENKEY is a random, secure, base64 string representing 16 bytes of data

Want to know more, check out [the blog](https://zillorz.dev/blog/dev/gradevuer), [an implementation](https://gradevuer.pages.dev), or message me on github!



### HELP WANTED
If you didn't know, I graduated recently :), however, I no longer have a working StudentVue account.

If you have a working StudentVue account, being able to collect some data would be extremely helpful, please contact me!
